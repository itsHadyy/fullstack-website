# Fullstack Website Repository - Hady Korshem

Welcome to the **Fullstack Website** repository! This project serves as a learning resource for students enrolled in the **Computer Applications in Business Course**. The repository demonstrates how to build a full-stack web application using modern technologies, including Node.js, MySQL, and React.js.

## Features

This project covers:

- Backend development using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- Database integration with **MySQL**.
- RESTful API creation and testing with **Postman**.
- Frontend development using **React.js**.

## Prerequisites

Before working on this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Suggested Tools

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing.
- A browser with developer tools (e.g., Google Chrome).

## How to Use This Repository

### Setup the Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder to configure environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   DB_NAME=yourdatabasename
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Setup the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the frontend server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Test the Application

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the frontend.
- Use Postman to test the APIs provided by the backend server running on `http://localhost:5000`.
